# Stock Market Analysis
## _Overview_ ##
This project provides an in-depth analysis of stock market data using Python. The analysis includes exploring historical trends, computing statistical measures, and predicting future stock behavior through a Monte Carlo simulation.

This project provides an in-depth analysis of stock market data using Python.

1. What was the change in the price of the stock over time?
2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3. What was the moving average of various stocks?
4. What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
5. What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
6. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
7. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?


## _Features_
1. *Basic Stock Analysis:* Analyze historical stock prices, moving averages, and correlations.
2. *Daily Returns:* Compute and visualize daily stock returns.
3. *Risk Assessment:* Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) for investments.
4. *Future Prediction:* Simulate future stock prices using the Monte Carlo method.

## _Tools and Libraries_ ## 
This project leverages the following Python libraries:
1. `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. `numpy`: For numerical computations.
3. `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Power BI (free version)
4. `yfinance`: To fetch stock market data.
5. `pandas_datareader`: For accessing financial data.
6. `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.


## _Data_ 
The analysis focuses on the following major tech stocks:
- Apple(AAPL)
- Google(GOOG)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Amazon (AMZN)

Stock data is fetched programmatically using `yfinance` and processed for insights.


## _Project Workflow_ ##
1. *Section 1: Basic Stock Analysis*:
   
   1.1. Load stock data.
   
   1.2.  Visualize historical trends and compute moving averages.
   
2. *Section 2: Daily Returns*:
   
   2.1. Analyze daily returns for each stock.
   
   2.2. Examine statistical properties and distributions.
   
3. *Section 3: Risk Assessment*:
   
   3.1. Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) using historical simulation.
   
4. *Section 4: Monte Carlo Simulation*:
   
   4.1. Predict future stock prices using Monte Carlo methods.

## _Usage_ ##
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook "Stock Market Analysis.ipynb"


## _Results_ ##

- Visualizations and statistical outputs provide insights into stock behavior and risks.

- Monte Carlo simulations predict future stock prices with probabilistic scenarios.
